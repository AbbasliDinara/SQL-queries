or

select listagg(substr('Dinara',level,1),' ') within group(order by level desc)

---------short way-
SELECT REVERSE('Dinara') AS ters
FROM dual;

------other way
select *
from students
where substr(studname,1,length(studname)/2)= reverse(substr(studname,(length(studname)/2)+1,length(studname)));
